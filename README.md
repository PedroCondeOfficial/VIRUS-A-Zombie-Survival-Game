						VIRUS: A Zombie Survival Game

	You, a lord of a land unknown find yourself trapped in your own palace as a horde of zombies attempt to overtake your estate. Armed with only a sword and a hint of magic, you have only one task: survive. 

	The zombies grow exponentially with each succeeding round. Every five rounds, a pack of hounds attempt to drag you back to hell with them. It only gets harder from there. Good luck.
